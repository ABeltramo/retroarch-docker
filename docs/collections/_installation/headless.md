# Headless host

This is where GOW really shines!

We'll take care of running and configuring:
- a desktop environment 
- with audio 
- inside Docker 
- that can support HW acceleration
- and with a streaming solution that:
    - it's low latency
    - supports keyboard, mouse and joypads
    - can be HW accelerated
- **!!!**

On top of that foundation layer you can run most of the GUI applications out there and even games!!
