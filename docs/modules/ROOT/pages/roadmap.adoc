== Roadmap

We are in a proof of concept phase right now. So far we have achieved
the following: - We know _itâ€™s possible_ to run HW accelerated games on
Docker - We have working environments in both `Debian` and `Unraid`,
with and without a GPU

We would like to achieve the following: - Make a general set of Docker
containers that can run any GUI app (as long as it can run on Docker) -
Make a _``launcher app''_ that will let users start/stop other GUI
containers _easily_ - This will be possible by passing the Docker socket
- Create a list of curated docker containers for popular GUI
applications like: Firefox, Steam, RetroArch, etc. - Support as many
platforms as we can - Create great documentation so that anybody can
understand and learn from this project
