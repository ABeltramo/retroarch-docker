== How can I use GOW?

Out of the box, by using the `docker-compose` default configuration, you
should be able to run `RetroArch` and play games remotely from another
machine. Itâ€™s all taken care from you and you only have to run the
following:

[source,bash]
....
git clone https://github.com/games-on-whales/gow.git
cd gow
mkdir local_state
run-gow [--headless] --app retroarch up -d
....

=== Can I use it for something else?

You should be able to run any Graphical Application on top of the basic
combination of `Xorg` + `PulseAudio` + `Sunshine`.  We supply compose files for
`steam`, `retroarch`, and `firefox` by default, but you can use them as
templates to create your own.  Then, you can use `--app [your app]` as an
argument to `run-gow` to launch your app.

A few things to note:
- This is an image that we didnâ€™t built:
  https://github.com/andrewmackrodt/dockerfiles/tree/master/firefox-x11[`andrewmackrodt/firefox-x11`]
  itâ€™s an open source Dockerfile and image. Itâ€™s a great example of running a
  container which wasnâ€™t built with GOW in mind.

* This container doesnâ€™t need to be run with `privileged: true` nor
`network_mode: host`. This is because mouse and keyboard events are
handled by `Xorg` and passing the `X11` socket is enough to have display
and inputs
** This increases security for non trusted containers by restricting the
things they can access
** If you would like to also have joypad support youâ€™ll have to use
`privileged` and `host` network just like in the `RetroArch` example

The main advantage is that if you have a desktop environment already,
you can run this Firefox container even without using any of the GOW
parts because you already have `Xorg`, `PulseAudio`, and possibly a
keyboard and mouse connected.

If you donâ€™t have a desktop environment, or you would like to have a
remote desktop solution that *is faster* than VNC or RDP that lets you
run GUI *with HW acceleration*, then *GOW* is the solution for you!

And it lets you re-use docker containers that can be run in both
environments!
