# How can I help?

:tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada:

There are many ways to contribute to this project!

Just by running it and reporting issues (or even letting us know everything works out of the box) you are helping us!

You don't have to code or understand all the little details of how everything work, helping us mantaining and expanding the documentation is another great way to help. Asking questions in the public [discussion board](https://github.com/games-on-whales/gow/discussions) is another great way to share knowledge for others.

Feel free to join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/kRGUDHNHt2) if you have any question, if you need any help, or you would like to join us on our journey!
